#Scenario 4
Catch landings are 0.001 for competition fleet
Index up through 2018 included - for 2015 to 2018 I = proj.index 
Added expected numbers killed in discards
	Calculated by F = harvest rate 
	(2217.922, 2017.759, 1980.822, 1824.6)
Std_in = 0 for discards for fleet 5
Fixed F for forecast F = proj.index[year] * 2014 Fcompetition (0.0499161)
