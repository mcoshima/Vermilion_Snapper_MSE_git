1 # Benchmarks: 0=skip; 1=calc F_spr,F_btgt,F_msy
#it calculates targets at MSY, SPR, and biomass targets all independently during model run
2 # MSY: 1= set to F(SPR); 2=calc F(MSY); 3=set to F(Btgt); 4=set to F(endyr)
3 # SPR target (e.g. 0.40)

1.0 # Control rule target as fraction of Flimit (e.g. 0.75)   # this is to do the F at OY - i.e. the 75 percent of Fmsy

#get final 2012 landings info from data:  commecial get from IFQ page, recreation may not be final and may have to do some hole filling - get with Vivian on this.
2011 #FirstYear for caps and allocations (should be after years with fixed inputs)  # thsi is the year when to start the projections - remember triggefish, when we added the landings from the last year sicne they wanted manamagement advice from current year
0 # stddev of log(realized catch/target catch) in forecast (set value>0.0 to cause active impl_error)
0 # Do West Coast gfish rebuilder output (0/1)
2011 # Rebuilder: first year catch could have been set to zero (Ydecl)(-1 to set to 1999)
2010 # Rebuilder: year for current age structure (Yinit) (-1 to set to endyear+1)
#this is how we allocate fishing effort and mortality with the fleets - i.e  we want a fixed effort for the shrimp fleets and constant level of closed season discards in the projections going forward - talk with Jake about how to do this
1 # fleet relative F: 1=use first-last alloc year; 2=read seas(row) x fleet(col) below
# Note that fleet allocation is used directly as average F if Do_Forecast=4
# this will just give you retained biomass and won't have to back out the discards
